# VR_course
Press space to switch between the shaders.

This is a project done for the course **Virtual Reality** given at the University of Lausanne by Isaac Pante. We learned to use the framework [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), but since I felt uncomfortable with it, we discussed about learning how to code some shaders. I provide shaders usable with the [KaboomJS](https://kaboomjs.com/) library, since they are best used in games. There are two "sections" to my work.

## Game shaders
These are shaders that are designed to be used in games. They affect the whole screen. They either change the colours of the screen, or add effects to it such as morphing, scanlines and animations. You can use them in specific scenes, for example if your game has a sad moment you can use the black and white shader, or an entire game, if you for example wish to reproduce the effect of playing on an old CRT screen or Macintosh.

## Shader art
The other section of my work are artful shaders, that replace the background image to display colourful animated patterns. The first one is a readaptation of [kishimishu's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY) on shader art coding for KaboomJS, since their original video was done using [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/). The others are original creations. They don't have a practical use like the first ones, but they are, I think, very cool to look at, and mesmerizing with their repeating patterns.

## Use
You can use these shaders freely. If you do, please provide a mention of my name and a link to this GitHub repository. Enjoy!
